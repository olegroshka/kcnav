# KCNav: Complexity-Guided Math Reasoning with ReAct Agents
Cmplexity-Guided ReAct Agents ‚Äì steer an LLM‚Äôs chain-of-thought with Normalised Compression Distance and a learned Transformer to solve maths problems more accurately and efficiently.

A research code-base that teaches a *local* large-language model (e.g. Gemma-9B, Phi-3) to reason about maths problems while **measuring and controlling the complexity of each reasoning step**.  
The agent follows the **ReAct** loop (Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Answer).  
A lightweight **Transformer** is trained on successful trajectories to predict whether a *candidate next step* keeps complexity in a ‚Äúproductive‚Äù range, enabling:

* **NCD-based candidate re-ranking** ‚Äì avoid meandering thought chains.  
* **Self-reflection** ‚Äì flag and critique suspicious complexity spikes.  

> *Diffusion complexity modelling is in the roadmap but disabled by default.*
